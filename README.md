# This is a Test feature branch

Owner of this branch - ndudhel [Neel Dudheliya](https://github.com/Neel317)

- This branch is an intermediary testing branch for Chunk-based compression algorithm. The final branch with the latest code can be found here. [parallel-search](https://github.com/tanay306/LogPress/tree/parallel-search)

- We are keeping all the test branch to show contribution.


## Prerequisites ‚úÖ
 
 - A C++ compiler with C++17 support (e.g., **g++** or **clang++**).
 - [zlib](https://zlib.net/) development library (ensure you link with `-lz`).
 - *(Optional)* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for generating the build configuration.
 
 ## Building the Project üõ†Ô∏è
 
 ### Using g++ Directly
 
 ```bash
 g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -lz main.cpp compressor.cpp decompressor.cpp searcher.cpp sqlite_helper.cpp -o logpress
 ```
 
 *Adjust the source file names if your project structure differs.*
 
 ### Using CMake
 
 1. **Generate Build System (output goes to `./build`):**
 
    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build
    ```
 
 2. **Build the Project:**
 
    ```bash
    cmake --build build
    ```
 
 3. **Run the Executable:**
 
    ```bash
    ./build/logpress
    ```
 
 ## Usage üìñ
 
 Once compiled, the executable (named **logpress**) supports the following commands:
 
 ### 1. Compressing Files
 
 Compress one or more log files into a single archive.
 
 ```bash
 ./logpress compress <archive> <file1> [file2 ...]
 ```
 
 **Example:**
 
 ```bash
 ./logpress compress archive.tmzl log1.txt log2.txt
 ```
 
 > This reads `log1.txt` and `log2.txt`, compresses them using a template-based approach combined with zlib compression, and produces an archive called `archive.tmzl`.
 
 ### 2. Decompressing an Archive
 
 Reconstruct the original log files from an archive into a specified output folder.
 
 ```bash
 ./logpress decompress <archive> <output_folder>
 ```
 
 **Example:**
 
 ```bash
 ./logpress decompress archive.tmzl output_logs
 ```
 
 > This extracts the compressed data from `archive.tmzl` and writes the reconstructed logs into the `output_logs` directory.
 
 ### 3. Searching Within an Archive
 
 Search for log lines matching a specific term within an archive without needing to decompress all files.
 
 ```bash
 ./logpress search <archive> <search_term>
 ```
 
 **Example:**
 
 ```bash
 ./logpress search archive.tmzl "ERROR"
 ```
 
 > This command searches the archive for any log lines containing the term `"ERROR"` and prints the matching lines along with their corresponding filenames.
 
 ## Internal Details üîç
 
 - **Template-Based Compression:**  
   Logpress deduplicates log entries by extracting and compressing common templates and numeric tokens.  
 - **Custom Zlib Dictionary:**  
   A custom dictionary is generated from templates, filenames, and variables. This dictionary is used during compression (and decompression) to improve compression ratios.
 - **Metadata Storage:**  
   A SQLite database is used to store metadata such as templates, variable values, and file names. This helps in reconstructing the original logs accurately.
 - **Regex-Based Classification:**  
   The project includes several regex patterns for classifying numeric tokens (e.g., IP addresses and timestamps), which are used during the template creation process.
 
 ## Additional Notes üìù
 
 - **Emojis & Visual Clarity:**  
   Emojis are used throughout the README to enhance readability and make the user guide more engaging.
 - **Project Structure:**  
   Core source files include:
   - `compressor.cpp`
   - `decompressor.cpp`
   - `searcher.cpp`
   - `sqlite_helper.cpp`
   - `main.cpp`
 - **Troubleshooting:**  
   - Ensure `zlib` is correctly installed and linked (use `-lz`).
   - For sqlite issues, if you're using Homebrew on macOS, you may need to adjust your PATH or force-link sqlite:
     ```bash
     brew link sqlite --force
     ```
     or add:
     ```bash
     export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlite/bin:$PATH"
     ```
     to your `~/.zshrc`.
 
 Enjoy using **Logpress** to effectively manage and search through your logs! üéâ
